# Linera Web packages

This directory contains bindings and utilities for using Linera from
the Web platform.

They are published on npm under the `@linera` namespace.

## Building

Make sure your `cargo` invokes a nightly `rustc`. Then, you can build
and publish the workspace with `pnpm publish -r`.
