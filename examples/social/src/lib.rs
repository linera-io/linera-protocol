//! # A Social Media Example Application
//!
//! This example illustrates how to use channels for cross-chain messages.
//!
//! For simplicity, each microchain represents one userâ€”its owner. They can subscribe to other
//! users and make text posts that get sent to their subscribers.
//!
//! ## How it Works
//!
//! The application's state on every microchain contains a set of posts created by this chain
//! owner, and a set of posts received from other chains that it has subscribed to. The
//! received posts are indexed by timestamp, sender and index.
//!
//! There are `Subscribe` and `Unsubscribe` operations: If a chain owner includes these in a
//! new block, they can subscribe to or unsubscribe from another chain.
//!
//! There is also a `Post` operation: It creates a new post and sends it to a channel, so that
//! it reaches all subscribers.
//!
//! There are corresponding `RequestSubscribe`, `RequestUnsubscribe` and `Posts` cross-chain
//! message variants that are created when these operations are handled. The first two are
//! sent directly to the chain we want to subscribe to or unsubscribe from. The latter goes
//! to the channel.
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! To try it out, first setup a local network with two wallets, and keep it running in a
//! separate terminal:
//!
//! ```bash
//! ./scripts/run_local.sh
//! ```
//!
//! Compile the `social` example and create an application with it:
//!
//! ```bash
//! alias linera="$PWD/target/debug/linera"
//! export LINERA_WALLET1="$(realpath target/debug/wallet.json)"
//! export LINERA_STORAGE1="rocksdb:$(dirname "$LINERA_WALLET1")/linera.db"
//! export LINERA_WALLET2="$(realpath target/debug/wallet_2.json)"
//! export LINERA_STORAGE2="rocksdb:$(dirname "$LINERA_WALLET2")/linera_2.db"
//!
//! cd examples/social && cargo build --release && cd ../..
//!
//! linera --wallet "$LINERA_WALLET1" --storage "$LINERA_STORAGE1" \
//!   publish-and-create examples/target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/social_{contract,service}.wasm
//! ```
//!
//! This will output the new application ID, e.g.:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! e476187f6ddfeb9d588c7b45d3df334d5501d6499b3f9ad5595cae86cce16a65010000000000000001000000e476187f6ddfeb9d588c7b45d3df334d5501d6499b3f9ad5595cae86cce16a65030000000000000000000000
//! ```
//!
//! With the `wallet show` command you can find the ID of the application creator's chain:
//!
//! ```bash
//! linera --wallet "$LINERA_WALLET1" --storage "$LINERA_STORAGE1" wallet show
//! ```
//!
//! ```ignore
//! e476187f6ddfeb9d588c7b45d3df334d5501d6499b3f9ad5595cae86cce16a65
//! ```
//!
//!
//! Now start a node service for each wallet, using two different ports:
//!
//! ```bash
//! linera --wallet "$LINERA_WALLET1" --storage "$LINERA_STORAGE1" service --port 8080 &
//! linera --wallet "$LINERA_WALLET2" --storage "$LINERA_STORAGE2" service --port 8081 &
//! ```
//!
//! Point your browser to http://localhost:8081. This is the wallet that didn't create the
//! application, so we have to request it from the creator chain. As the chain ID specify the
//! one of the chain where it isn't registered yet:
//!
//! ```json
//! mutation {
//!     requestApplication(
//!         chainId: "1db1936dad0717597a7743a8353c9c0191c14c3a129b258e9743aec2b4f05d03",
//!         applicationId: "e476187f6ddfeb9d588c7b45d3df334d5501d6499b3f9ad5595cae86cce16a65010000000000000001000000e476187f6ddfeb9d588c7b45d3df334d5501d6499b3f9ad5595cae86cce16a65030000000000000000000000"
//!     )
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Now in both http://localhost:8080 and http://localhost:8081, this should list the
//! application and provide a link to its GraphQL API. Remember to use each wallet's chain ID:
//!
//! ```json
//! query { applications(
//!     chainId:"1db1936dad0717597a7743a8353c9c0191c14c3a129b258e9743aec2b4f05d03"
//! ) { id link } }
//! ```
//!
//! Open both URLs under the entry `link`. Now you can use the application on each chain.
//! E.g. in the 8081 tab subscribe to the other chain:
//!
//! ```json
//! mutation {
//!     subscribe(
//!         chainId: "e476187f6ddfeb9d588c7b45d3df334d5501d6499b3f9ad5595cae86cce16a65"
//!     )
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Now make a post in the 8080 tab:
//!
//! ```json
//! mutation {
//!     post(
//!         text: "Linera Social is the new Mastodon!"
//!     )
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Since 8081 is a subscriber. Let's see if it received any posts:
//!
//! ```json
//! query { receivedPostsKeys { timestamp author index } }
//! ```
//!
//! This should now list one entry, with timestamp, author and an index. If we view that
//! entry, we can see the posted text:
//!
//! ```json
//! query {
//!   receivedPosts(
//!     key: {
//!       timestamp: 1685626618522492,
//!       author: "e476187f6ddfeb9d588c7b45d3df334d5501d6499b3f9ad5595cae86cce16a65",
//!       index: 0
//!     }
//!   )
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ```json
//! {
//!   "data": {
//!     "receivedPosts": "Linera Social is the new Mastodon!"
//!   }
//! }
//! ```
