/// TODO(#841): Implementing fractional price is preferable for some exchanges. This cause some

/// ourselves to fractions of the form say x / 100000.
/// The next problem is that if we do the fractions, then the order can only be filled partially. And
/// in a mathematical way, Euclidean divisions have to be done.
