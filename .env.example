# Environment configuration for Linera Protocol Makefile
#
# The Makefile uses public demo infrastructure by default (gs://demos.linera.net)
# which is safe to use for testing and public demos.
#
# For private/internal deployments, override these variables:

# Network configuration
# NETWORK_NAME=testnet-conway

# Private deployment configuration (optional)
# Override only if deploying to your own infrastructure
# GCS_BUCKET=gs://your-private-bucket
# URL_MAP=your-private-url-map

# Custom wallet directory (optional, defaults to temp)
# WALLET_DIR=/path/to/your/wallet/dir

# Note: The default values in the Makefile point to public infrastructure
# and are safe to expose in a public repository
