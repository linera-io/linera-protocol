//! This module provides an SDK for developing Linera applications using Rust.
//!
//! A Linera application consists of two WebAssembly binaries: a contract and a service.
//! In both binaries, there should be a shared application state. The state is a type that
//! represents what the application would like to persist in storage across blocks, and
//! must implement the [`Contract`](crate::Contract) trait in the contract binary and the
//! [`Service`](crate::Service) trait in the service binary.
//!
//! The application can select between two storage backends to use. Selecting the storage
//! backend is done by specifying both the [`Contract::Storage`](crate::Contract::Storage)
//! and the [`Service::Storage`](crate::Service::Storage) associated types.
//!
//! The [`SimpleStateStorage`](crate::SimpleStateStorage) backend stores the application's
//! state type by serializing it into binary blob. This allows the entire contents of the
//! state to be persisted and made available to the application when it is executed.
//!
//! The [`ViewStateStorage`](crate::ViewStateStorage) backend stores the application's
//! state using the
//! [`linera-views`](https://docs.rs/linera-views/latest/linera_views/index.html), a
//! framework that allows loading selected parts of the state. This is useful if the
//! application's state is large and doesn't need to be loaded in its entirety for every
//! execution.
//!
//! The contract binary should use the [`contract!`](crate::contract!) macro to export the application's contract
//! endpoints implemented via the [`Contract`](crate::Contract) trait implementation.
//!
//! The service binary should use the [`service!`](crate::service!) macro to export the application's service
//! endpoints implemented via the [`Service`](crate::Service) trait implementation.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! The [`examples`](https://github.com/linera-io/linera-protocol/tree/main/examples)
//! directory contains some example applications.
