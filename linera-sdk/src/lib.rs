//! This module provides an SDK for developing Linera applications using Rust.
//!
//! A Linera application consists of two WebAssembly binaries: a contract and a service.
//! In both binaries, there should be a shared application state. The state is a type that
//! represents what the application would like to persist in storage across blocks, and
//! must implement [`State`](crate::State) trait in order to specify how the state should be loaded
//! from and stored to the persistent key-value storage. An alternative is to use the
//! [`linera-views`](https://docs.rs/linera-views/latest/linera_views/index.html), a framework that
//! allows loading selected parts of the state. This is useful if the application's state is large
//! and doesn't need to be loaded in its entirety for every execution. By deriving
//! [`RootView`](views::RootView) on the state type it automatically implements the [`State`]
//! trait.
//!
//! The contract binary should create a type to implement the [`Contract`](crate::Contract) trait.
//! The type can store the [`ContractRuntime`](contract::ContractRuntime) and the state, and must
//! have its implementation exported by using the [`contract!`](crate::contract!) macro.
//!
//! The service binary should create a type to implement the [`Service`](crate::Service) trait.
//! The type can store the [`ServiceRuntime`](service::ServiceRuntime) and the state, and must have
//! its implementation exported by using the [`service!`](crate::service!) macro.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! The [`examples`](https://github.com/linera-io/linera-protocol/tree/main/examples)
//! directory contains some example applications.
