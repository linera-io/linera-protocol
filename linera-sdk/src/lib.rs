//! This module provides an SDK for developing Linera applications using Rust.
//!
//! A Linera application consists of two WebAssembly binaries: a contract and a service.
//! Both binaries have access to the same application and chain specific storage. The service only
//! has read-only access, while the contract can write to it. The storage should be used to store
//! the application state, which is persisted across blocks. The state can be a custom type that
//! uses [`linera-views`](https://docs.rs/linera-views/latest/linera_views/index.html), a framework
//! that allows lazily loading selected parts of the state. This is useful if the application's
//! state is large and doesn't need to be loaded in its entirety for every execution.
//!
//! The contract binary should create a type to implement the [`Contract`](crate::Contract) trait.
//! The type can store the [`ContractRuntime`](contract::ContractRuntime) and the state, and must
//! have its implementation exported by using the [`contract!`](crate::contract!) macro.
//!
//! The service binary should create a type to implement the [`Service`](crate::Service) trait.
//! The type can store the [`ServiceRuntime`](service::ServiceRuntime) and the state, and must have
//! its implementation exported by using the [`service!`](crate::service!) macro.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! The [`examples`](https://github.com/linera-io/linera-protocol/tree/main/examples)
//! directory contains some example applications.
