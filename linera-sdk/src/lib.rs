//! An SDK for developing Linera applications using Rust.
//!
//! A Linera application consists of two WebAssembly binaries: a contract and a service. In both
//! binaries, there should be a shared application state. The state is a type that represents what
//! the application would like to persist in storage across blocks, and must implement the
//! [`Contract`] trait in the contract binary and the [`Service`] trait in the service binary.
//!
//! The application can select between two storage backends to use. Selecting the storage backend
//! is done by specifying both the [`Contract::Storage`] and the [`Service::Storage`] associated
//! types.
//!
//! The [`SimpleStateStorage`] backend stores the application's state type by serializing it into
//! binary blob. This allows the entire contents of the state to be persisted and made available to
//! the application when it is executed.
//!
//! The [`ViewStateStorage`] backend stores the application's state using the [`linera-views`], a
//! framework that allows loading selected parts of the state. This is useful if the application's
//! state is large and doesn't need to be loaded in its entirety for every execution.
//!
//! The contract binary should use the [`contract!`] macro to export the application's contract
//! endpoints implemented via the [`Contract`] trait implementation.
//!
//! The service binary should use the [`service!`] macro to export the application's service
//! endpoints implemented via the [`Service`] trait implementation.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! The [`linera-examples`](https://github.com/linera-io/linera-protocol/tree/main/linera-examples)
//! directory contains some example applications.
