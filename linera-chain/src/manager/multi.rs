//! # Manager for Multi-Owner Chains
//!
//! This module contains the consensus mechanism for multi-owner chains. Whenever a block is
//! confirmed, a new chain manager is created for the next block height. It manages the consensus
//! state until a new block is confirmed. As long as less than a third of the validators are faulty,
//! it guarantees that at most one `ConfirmedBlock` certificate will be created for this height.
//! There are two modes of operation:
//!
//! * In cooperative mode, all chain owners can propose blocks at any time. The protocol is
//!   guaranteed to eventually confirm a block as long as no chain owner continuously actively
//!   prevents progress.
//! * In leader rotation mode, chain owners take turns at proposing blocks. It can make progress
//!   as long as at least one owner is honest, even if other owners try to prevent it.
//!
//! ## Safety, i.e. at most one block will be confirmed
//!
//! In both modes is guaranteed as follows:
//!
//! * Validators (honest ones) never cast a vote if they have already cast any vote in a later
//!   round.
//! * Validators never vote for a `ValidatedBlock` **A** in round **r** if they have voted for a
//!   _different_ `ConfirmedBlock` **B** in an earlier round **s** â‰¤ **r**, unless there is a
//!   `ValidatedBlock` certificate (with a quorum of validator signatures) for **A** in some round
//!   between **s** and **r**.
//! * Validators only vote for a `ConfirmedBlock` if there is a `ValidatedBlock` certificate for the
//!   same block in the same round.
//!
//! This guarantees that once a quroum votes for some `ConfirmedBlock`, there can never be a
//! `ValidatedBlock` certificate (and thuse also no `ConfirmedBlock` certificate) for a different
//! block in a later round. So if there are two different `ConfirmedBlock` certificates, they may
//! be from different rounds, but they are guaranteed to contain the same block.
//!
//!
//! ## Liveness, i.e. some block will eventually be confirmed
//!
//! In cooperative mode, if there is contention, the owners need to agree on a single owner as the
//! next proposer. That owner should then download all highest-round certificates and block
//! proposals known to the honest validators. They can then make a proposal in a round higher than
//! all previous proposals. If there is any `ValidatedBlock` certificate they must include the
//! highest one in their proposal, and propose that block. Otherwise they can propose a new block.
//! Now all honest validators are allowed to vote for that proposal, and eventually confirm it.
//!
//! In leader-based mode, an honest owner should subscribe to notifications from all validators,
//! and follow the chain. Whenever another leader's round takes too long, they should request
//! timeout votes from the validators to make the next round begin. Once the honest owner becomes
//! the round leader, they should update all validators, so that they all agree on the current
//! round. Then they download the highest `ValidatedBlock` certificate known to any honest validator
//! and include that in their block proposal, just like in the cooperative case.
