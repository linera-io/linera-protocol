//! # Chain manager
//!
//! This module contains the consensus mechanism for all microchains. Whenever a block is
//! confirmed, a new chain manager is created for the next block height. It manages the consensus
//! state until a new block is confirmed. As long as less than a third of the validators are faulty,
//! it guarantees that at most one `ConfirmedBlock` certificate will be created for this height.
//!
//! The protocol proceeds in rounds, until it reaches a round where a block gets confirmed.
//!
//! There are four kinds of rounds:
//!
//! * In `Round::Fast`, only super owners can propose blocks, and validators vote to confirm a
//!   block immediately. Super owners must be careful to make only one block proposal, or else they
//!   can permanently block the microchain. If there are no super owners, `Round::Fast` is skipped.
//! * In cooperative mode (`Round::MultiLeader`), all chain owners can propose blocks at any time.
//!   The protocol is guaranteed to eventually confirm a block as long as no chain owner
//!   continuously actively prevents progress.
//! * In leader rotation mode (`Round::SingleLeader`), chain owners take turns at proposing blocks.
//!   It can make progress as long as at least one owner is honest, even if other owners try to
//!   prevent it.
//! * In fallback/public mode (`Round::Validator`), validators take turns at proposing blocks.
//!   It can always make progress under the standard assumption that there is a quorum of honest
//!   validators.
//!
//! ## Safety, i.e. at most one block will be confirmed
//!
//! In all modes this is guaranteed as follows:
//!
//! * Validators (honest ones) never cast a vote if they have already cast any vote in a later
//!   round.
//! * Validators never vote for a `ValidatedBlock` **A** in round **r** if they have voted for a
//!   _different_ `ConfirmedBlock` **B** in an earlier round **s** â‰¤ **r**, unless there is a
//!   `ValidatedBlock` certificate (with a quorum of validator signatures) for **A** in some round
//!   between **s** and **r** included in the block proposal.
//! * Validators only vote for a `ConfirmedBlock` if there is a `ValidatedBlock` certificate for the
//!   same block in the same round. (Or, in the `Fast` round, if there is a valid proposal.)
//!
//! This guarantees that once a quorum votes for some `ConfirmedBlock`, there can never be a
//! `ValidatedBlock` certificate (and thus also no `ConfirmedBlock` certificate) for a different
//! block in a later round. So if there are two different `ConfirmedBlock` certificates, they may
//! be from different rounds, but they are guaranteed to contain the same block.
//!
//! ## Liveness, i.e. some block will eventually be confirmed
//!
//! In `Round::Fast`, liveness depends on the super owners coordinating, and proposing at most one
//! block.
//!
//! If they propose none, and there are other owners, `Round::Fast` will eventually time out.
//!
//! In cooperative mode, if there is contention, the owners need to agree on a single owner as the
//! next proposer. That owner should then download all highest-round certificates and block
//! proposals known to the honest validators. They can then make a proposal in a round higher than
//! all previous proposals. If there is any `ValidatedBlock` certificate they must include the
//! highest one in their proposal, and propose that block. Otherwise they can propose a new block.
//! Now all honest validators are allowed to vote for that proposal, and eventually confirm it.
//!
//! If the owners fail to cooperate, any honest owner can initiate the last multi-leader round by
//! making a proposal there, then wait for it to time out, which starts the leader-based mode:
//!
//! In leader-based and fallback/public mode, an honest participant should subscribe to
//! notifications from all validators, and follow the chain. Whenever another leader's round takes
//! too long, they should request timeout votes from the validators to make the next round begin.
//! Once the honest participant becomes the round leader, they should update all validators, so
//! that they all agree on the current round. Then they download the highest `ValidatedBlock`
//! certificate known to any honest validator and include that in their block proposal, just like
//! in the cooperative case.
