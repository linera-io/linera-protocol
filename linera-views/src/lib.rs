//! This module is used in the Linera protocol to map complex data structures onto a
//! key-value store. The central notion is a [`views::View`](crate::views::View) which can
//! be loaded from storage, modified in memory, then committed (i.e. the changes are
//! atomically persisted in storage).
//!
//! The package provides essentially two functionalities:
//! * An abstraction to access databases.
//! * Several containers named views for storing data modeled on classical ones.
//!
//! See `DESIGN.md` for more details.
//!
//! ## The supported databases.
//!
//! The databases supported are of the NoSQL variety and they are key-value stores.
//!
//! We provide support for the following databases:
//! * `MemoryClient` is using the memory
//! * `RocksDbClient` is a disk-based key-value store
//! * `DynamoDbClient` is the AWS-based DynamoDB service.
//!
//! The corresponding type in the code is the `KeyValueStoreClient`.
//! A context is the combination of a client and a path (named `base_key` which is
//! of type `Vec<u8>`).
//!
//! ## Views.
//!
//! A view is a container whose data lies in one of the above-mentioned databases.
//! When the container is modified the modification lies first in the view before
//! being committed to the database. In technical terms, a view implements the trait `View`.
//!
//! The specific functionalities of the trait `View` are the following:
//! * `load` for loading the view from a specific context.
//! * `rollback` for canceling all modifications that were not committed thus far.
//! * `clear` for clearing the view, in other words for reverting it to its default state.
//! * `flush` for persisting the changes to storage.
//! * `delete` for deleting the changes from the database.
//!
//! The following views implement the `View` trait:
//! * `RegisterView` implements the storing of a single data.
//! * `LogView` implements a log, which is a list of entries that can be expanded.
//! * `QueueView` implements a queue, which is a list of entries that can be expanded and reduced.
//! * `MapView` implements a map with keys and values.
//! * `SetView` implements a set with keys.
//! * `CollectionView` implements a map whose values are views themselves.
//! * `ReentrantCollectionView` implements a map for which different keys can be accessed independently.
//! * `ViewContainer<C>` implements a `KeyValueStoreClient` and is used internally.
//!
//! The `LogView` can be seen as an analog of `VecDeque` while `MapView` is an analog of `BTreeMap`.
