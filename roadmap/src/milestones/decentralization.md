# Auditing and resilience

The goal of this milestone is to optimize "decentralization" by minimizing the trust put in large validators.

See also the [blog draft](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zjOjENEf9-WHXVVXfKZskssrn-kHIHl9WeR1I2bPnec/) on "resilience" w.r.t. corrupted validators.

## Requirements (TODO)

* Data format for the "tree of chains" is specified.

* Data can be explored (eventually through a web interface ?).

* Certificates can be verified.

* The set of validators who contributed to a certificate is visible.

* "Execution" of user commands can be replayed to verify the chains.

* "Validation" of user commands can be challenged (requesting additional "received certificates").
