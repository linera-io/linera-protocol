# Writing Linera application frontends

Linera comes with a Web client library that supports calling applications using
a JavaScript API directly inside Web pages.

After you complete this section, you'll know how to build interactive frontends
for Linera applications, taking advantage of Linera's push notifications to
implement realtime reactivity.

We're going to be building a frontend for the `counter` example we covered in
[Writing Application Backends](backend.md), so make sure to either complete that
first or deploy the completed application from the `linera-protocol` `examples`
directory and take a note of the resulting application ID.
