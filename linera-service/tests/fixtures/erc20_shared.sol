//
// This implementation has been adapted to our need in the following
// ways:
// * The totalSupply() of this contract is constant and fixed at
//   construction to be the total one. It returns the sum of the supply
//   over all the chains.
// * The localSupply() has been introduced to return the supply of one
//   particular chain.
// * When tokens are transfered to another chain, they are first burned
//   on the sender chain and then minted on the receiving chain.
// * The token can be transferred to another chain but under the same
//   user.

/**
 * @dev Implementation of the {IERC20} interface.

 *
 * TIP: For a detailed writeup see our guide
 * https://forum.openzeppelin.com/t/how-to-implement-erc20-supply-mechanisms/226[How

 *
 * The default value of {decimals} is 18. To change this, you should override

 * We have followed general OpenZeppelin Contracts guidelines: functions revert

 * conventional and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC-20
